# Angular Starter

Look at the [Angular documentation](https://angular.dev/overview) to learn more.

## Setup

Make sure to install dependencies:

```bash
# npm
npm install

# bun
bun install
```

## Development Server

Start the development server on `http://localhost:4200`:

```bash
# npm
npm run start

# bun
bun run start
```

## Production

Build the application for production:

```bash
# npm
npm run build

# bun

Optionally serve the production build locally:

npx http-server dist
```
